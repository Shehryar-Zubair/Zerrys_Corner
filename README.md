**Zerry’s Corner** - Restaurant Database System
This project was developed as part of our database course, where my partner and I designed and implemented a restaurant management system for Zerry’s Corner.
The system facilitates order processing, menu updates, and customer feedback, Order Logs while ensuring efficient data retrieval.

Tech Stack:
Backend: PHP, MySQL
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Database Structure:
The database consists of five main tables that manage restaurant operations:

Customers: Stores customer details (ID, name, email, phone, address).
Menu: Maintains food items with their names and prices.
Orders: Tracks orders with timestamps, total amounts, and statuses.
Order_Items: Links menu items to specific orders, including quantities.
Feedback: Captures customer reviews to improve service.
This project provides real-time order Logging, customer authentication, and dynamic menu management to streamline restaurant operations.
